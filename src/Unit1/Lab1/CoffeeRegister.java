        /*
        REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
        1. What happens when you store a double in an int? What is lost?
        Ans: The decimals behind the number will be lost.
        2. Why does 5 / 2 give 2, not 2.5?
        Ans: Because when we use int, it doesn't show the decimal places.
        3. When would you use explicit casting? When is it automatic?
        Ans: Because sometimes, we need to show the decimal part. When you switch from a double to int, it will automatically delete the decimal places.
        4. What's one real-world situation where ++x vs x++ could cause a bug?
        Ans: When using the wrong code, it will come to unexpected results.
        5. What surprised you most about how Java handles numbers?
        Ans: It is a bit complicated when handling doubles and ints.
